# SpaceFL Project Map

Last verified: 2026-08-16

## Purpose

SpaceFL is a modular research framework for federated learning in space and LEO satellite-network settings. This document is the entry point for agents and contributors. It records current code boundaries and evidence, not aspirational features.

## Architecture

## Research Assets

Local literature and analysis live in `文献/`. Primary current anchors include:

- FedLEO: `文献/[22]_Zhai2024_FedLEO_中文翻译.md` and `fl_space/fedleo/`.
- Ground-assisted and scheduling baselines: `文献/[20]_Razmi2022_Ground-Assisted_FL_LEO_中文翻译.md` and `文献/[21]_Razmi2022_Scheduling_FL_LEO_中文翻译.md`.
- Communication-efficient decentralized direction: `文献/[23]_DFedSat2025_通信高效鲁棒去中心化FL_中文分析.md` and `文献/README_通信压缩模块文献指南.md`.
- Broader direction and project choices: `太空联邦学习研究分析报告.md` and `docs/基础太空联邦算法改进与开源采用建议_20260813.md`.

## FedLEO Boundary

`fl_space/fedleo/conformance.py` is authoritative for the FedLEO implementation claim. At this map revision, the repository provides a lightweight discrete simulation with non-IID satellite datasets, ISL-neighbor offloading, greedy iterative offloading, weighted intra/inter-plane aggregation, and metrics.

The standard 20260812 validation did execute four offload actions in round 2 (262 samples total), then stopped after the distribution became balanced. The controlled trigger script uses severe sample imbalance, one-round scheduling, low communication penalty, and repeated-action gates to distinguish a one-time action from sustained planner activation.

It deliberately approximates discrete ratio search, divergence, ring aggregation, delay, and topology. It does not implement the paper's KKT communication-power optimization, multi-hop streaming contention/channel gain, dynamic cross-seam contact constraints, or full continuous P1-P4 optimization. Do not state otherwise without changing that metadata and adding validation.

## Near-Term Direction

1. Implement communication compression as a bounded experiment, beginning with a measurable byte/time model and a no-compression control. The literature guide proposes integration points in `fl_space/fedleo/aggregator.py`, `fl_space/isl/base.py`, `fl_space/fl/fedbuff.py`, `fl_space/fl/scheduler.py`, and `fl_space/fl/time_model.py`.
2. Improve dynamic topology and contact realism before making stronger decentralized-FL claims.
3. Use multi-seed controlled experiments to measure accuracy, convergence time, transmitted bytes, delay/staleness, fairness, and resource cost together.
4. Retain clear separation between simulator fidelity and operational satellite feasibility.

## Maintenance Rules

- Update this map after changing a module boundary, implementation classification, experiment entry point, validated result, or research direction.
- Verify every code-status statement against source/tests and every research-status statement against a local paper or result artifact.
- Put chronological detail in `WORKLOG.md`; keep this document concise and current.
- Record command, config, seed, revision, metrics, and output path for material experiments.
